1,Timing,How did Livingston’s winning bucket shop method fail when he used it in a real brokerage office?,"In a brokerage office, the tape was “ancient history”; the price printed on the tape was often behind actual trading on the floor, making his timing method fail.","Livingston's winning bucket shop method failed when he used it in a real brokerage office because the execution and prices were not as predictable or favorable as they were in the bucket shops. In the real market, there are more moves of one or two points than of ten or fifteen, making it harder to predict price movements and execute trades successfully.",False,0.375,0.6427586078643799,0.125,2.2111801242236027,0.6,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.127,0.182,5,8.395,2.837,356,161
2,Timing,Why did Livingston say he needed the tape to be absolutely current?,"Because even a small delay in the quoted price made his signals unreliable, and he depended on precise timing for his trades.","Based on the provided information, there is no mention of Livingston saying that he needs the tape to be absolutely current. The text does not provide any context or reason for why Livingston might have said such a thing. Therefore, I cannot answer this question based on the provided information.",False,0.0,0.517764687538147,0.08620689655172414,2.376,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.04,0.2,5,5.022,1.722,297,125
3,Timing,Why did Livingston believe that tape reading in a brokerage office was dangerously misleading?,Because discrepancies between the printed tape price and the real floor price could cause a trader to enter at the wrong moment.,"Livingston believed that tape reading in a brokerage office was dangerously misleading because he thought it created an illusion of control and precision. He noted that prices move either up or down according to the resistance they encounter, but this process is inherently unpredictable.

In particular, Livingston pointed out that when a trader gives an order to buy at the market, they never know what the stock will cost them until they receive a report from their brokers. This means that even with access to real-time price data (i.e., ""tape reading""), traders are still subject to uncertainty and unpredictability in the markets.

Livingston's point is not that tape reading itself is misleading, but rather that it creates an illusion of control and precision among traders who rely on it. In reality, the markets are inherently unpredictable, and even with access to real-time price data, traders must always be prepared for unexpected events and outcomes.",False,0.42857142857142855,0.7464843988418579,0.09090909090909091,7.5390625,0.8,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.244,0.333,5,9.131,2.496,965,128
4,Timing,What problem did Livingston notice about the stock tables printed in newspapers?,"He observed that newspaper prices were often several points away from the real market price, making them useless for trading decisions.","Livingston noticed that when a man gives an order to buy at the market, he never knows what that stock is going to cost him until he gets a report from the brokers. This suggests that he was concerned with the lack of transparency and immediacy in the stock prices reported by newspapers.",False,0.3333333333333333,0.6968877911567688,0.10344827586206896,2.1333333333333333,0.6,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.133,0.333,5,6.237,2.258,288,135
5,Timing,Why did Livingston insist that a trader’s business with the tape is “now”?,Because a trader must act instantly; the market does not wait for explanations or news to arrive.,"Livingston insisted that a trader's business with the tape is ""now"" because he believed that traders must act instantly, without delay, in response to market conditions as reflected by the ticker tape. This emphasis on immediacy was likely driven by Livingston's experience and understanding of how quickly markets can change and opportunities arise or disappear.",False,0.5,0.7331865429878235,0.17543859649122806,3.7422680412371134,0.8,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.229,0.571,5,6.391,2.52,363,97
6,Timing,"What happens, according to Livingston, when a trader delays action waiting for reasons behind a price move?","He misses the opportunity because reasons appear much later, long after the price has moved.","According to Livingston, when a trader delays action waiting for reasons behind a price move, the market can't stand much more pressure. This delay can lead to an immensely difficult task to avert a devastating panic.",False,0.2727272727272727,0.723320484161377,0.09523809523809523,2.358695652173913,0.8,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.062,0.154,5,5.113,2.595,217,92
7,Timing,Why did Livingston say he never asked the tape “why”?,"Because the tape only records movements, not reasons, and reasons usually come after the move is over.","Livingston said he never asks the tape ""why"" because, as he explained, the reason for a stock's movement may not be known for days or even weeks after the fact. He emphasizes that what matters is not knowing why something happened, but rather acting on it immediately. In this context, asking the tape ""why"" would be unnecessary and potentially distracting from taking immediate action based on the information provided by the tape.",False,0.36363636363636365,0.6769508123397827,0.10606060606060606,4.235294117647059,0.8,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.15,0.5,5,6.795,2.658,432,102
8,Timing,What example does Livingston give to show that news often follows price action?,"He cites the case of Hollow Tube, which dropped several points before the official news that its dividend was passed.","Livingston gives the example of Intervale Oil stock. He says that when the stock began to decline, people started asking why the stock was weak. The brokers who were members of the bull pool then gave an explanation: Larry Livingston (the narrator) was raiding the market! This shows how news often follows price action, with explanations being given after the fact to justify what has already happened in the market.",False,0.14285714285714285,0.5130627155303955,0.08823529411764706,3.5641025641025643,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.1,0.167,5,6.579,2.637,417,117
9,Timing,Why did Livingston say there was no inside buying in Hollow Tube before the bad news?,"Because people who knew the dividend was going to be passed either sold beforehand or avoided buying, leaving no support for the price.","Livingston said there was no inside buying in Hollow Tube because he didn't sell the stock himself and his firm, which would be acting as brokers for him, also didn't buy it. He implied that if there were any insider trading going on, it wouldn't have been done through his own actions or those of his firm.",False,0.21428571428571427,0.6075422763824463,0.140625,2.274074074074074,0.6,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.1,0.25,5,5.681,2.106,307,135
10,Timing,How did Livingston learn to recognize these price patterns over time?,"By keeping notes, reviewing past behavior, and comparing predictions with actual tape movements until the repetitions became obvious to him.","Livingston learned to recognize price patterns through careful and minute study of the behavior of prices in many markets—stocks, bonds, grain, cotton, money, and so on. He went back years and years and traced the correlations and seasonal movements oh, everything. This extensive study allowed him to develop a deep understanding of how prices behave over time, enabling him to recognize price patterns that others might miss.",False,0.13333333333333333,0.5303454399108887,0.09090909090909091,3.05,0.8,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.15,0.375,5,6.584,2.606,427,140
