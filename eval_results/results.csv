1,Timing,How did Livingston’s winning bucket shop method fail when he used it in a real brokerage office?,"In a brokerage office, the tape was “ancient history”; the price printed on the tape was often behind actual trading on the floor, making his timing method fail.","Livingston's winning bucket shop method failed when he used it in a real brokerage office because the execution and market conditions were vastly different.

However, in a real brokerage office, prices are determined by actual market forces, including supply and demand, news events, and other factors that can affect stock prices.
