1,Timing,Why did Livingston say he never asked the tape for reasons?,Because the tape only tells what is happening; reasons come after the move.,Livingston said he never asked the tape for reasons because stock-market postmortems don't pay dividends.,False,0.3,0.5072486996650696,0.16,1.4,0.825,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.9,"Answer is mostly accurate and complete, but some claims are not directly supported by the context. The quote about stock-market postmortems is not mentioned in the context, but the general idea is implied.",0.04,0.2,5,8.059,2.176,105,75,border
6,Timing,Why was there no insider buying in Hollow Tube?,Because those who knew the truth refused to buy in a bull market.,"The text doesn't specifically state why there was no insider buying in Hollow Tube. However, it mentions that insiders knew exactly why they should not buy their own stock in a bull market. This implies that the reason for the lack of insider buying is related to the company's financial situation or some other factor that makes buying the stock unwise even for insiders.",False,0.4285714285714285,0.6503052115440369,0.1403508771929824,5.723076923076923,0.8,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.8,"Answer is mostly accurate and complete, but some minor inferences are made without direct context support.",0.2,0.6,5,10.761,1.54,372,65,border
7,Timing,Why did Livingston say stock tables in newspapers were unreliable?,Because they often differed by several points from the real market price.,"Livingston didn't explicitly say that stock tables in newspapers were unreliable. However, he did mention that the easy acceptance of bear raiding as an explanation for market declines has been responsible for losses by the public amounting to millions upon millions of dollars.

This suggests that Livingston may have believed that relying on newspaper reports and explanations can be misleading or even detrimental to one's investment decisions.",False,0.1,0.6200435757637024,0.0434782608695652,6.123287671232877,0.825,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.9,"Answer is mostly accurate and complete, but some claims are not directly supported by the context.

12,Timing,What was Livingston’s method for spotting price repetitions?,He compared his predictions with the tape and looked for repeating behaviors.,"Livingston's method for spotting price repetitions is not explicitly described in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that Livingston used a combination of technical analysis and market observation to identify repeating patterns in stock prices.

In particular, Livingston mentions using ""practically the same tactics"" as he did when covering his shorts during Stratton's corn cornering scheme. This suggests that Livingston may have been using some form of pattern recognition or chart analysis to spot opportunities for profit.

However, without more specific information about Livingston's methods, it is difficult to provide a detailed description of how he spotted price repetitions.",False,0.2857142857142857,0.6155605912208557,0.0697674418604651,9.07792207792208,0.725,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.9,"The model answer is partially accurate and complete, but its claims are not fully supported by the context.

However, it is partially complete as it does not provide any alternative information on how Livingston trained himself. The model answer is faithful as it directly quotes the context, but it could be more complete. The answer is clear and well-structured.",0.12,0.4,5,5.721,2.606,95,54,border
16,Timing,Why did Livingston dislike “cheap stock” buying?,Because stocks are cheap for a reason and often go even lower.,"Livingston disliked ""cheap stock"" buying because it was a form of speculation that he believed would lead to market instability. He thought that when people buy stocks at low prices, they are not making informed investment decisions but rather speculating on the potential for quick profits.",False,0.4285714285714285,0.7441615462303162,0.12,4.693548387096774,0.825,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.9,"Answer is mostly accurate and complete, but some claims are not directly supported by the context.

21,Timing,What did Livingston learn from repeated market behavior?,That patterns repeat because human nature does not change.,"Livingston learned that the average stock speculator makes mistakes year in and year out due to ignorance. He realized that he himself had made similar mistakes, but with time and experience gained from repeated market behavior, he came to understand what he did not know then.",False,0.25,0.530980110168457,0.0444444444444444,4.775862068965517,0.725,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.9,"The model answer is mostly accurate, but partially incomplete. It correctly states that Livingston learned from repeated market behavior, but does not directly address the reference answer's point about human nature not changing. The answer is somewhat faithful, as it mentions Livingston's mistakes and experience, but does not directly support the reference answer's claim. The answer is clear and well-organized.",0.2,0.286,5,9.632,2.783,277,58,border
24,Timing,Why did Livingston avoid acting on rumors?,Because the tape was more reliable than rumors or explanations.,"Livingston avoided acting on rumors because he knew that they were often unreliable and could lead to costly mistakes. He also seemed to have a good understanding of the market and its dynamics, which allowed him to make more informed decisions based on his own research and analysis rather than relying solely on rumors or hearsay.",False,0.7142857142857143,0.673183262348175,0.1153846153846153,5.26984126984127,0.825,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.9,"Answer is mostly accurate and complete, but some claims are not directly supported by the context.

25,Timing,Why did Livingston distrust pool explanations?,Because they often justified moves that had already happened.,"Livingston distrusts pool explanations because he believes that they are often used to deceive the public. He notes that in a bull market, the public tends to overstay and lose money due to ""bear raids"" being blamed for their losses.",False,0.5,0.5451571345329285,0.1025641025641025,3.819672131147541,0.775,0.8,0.7,0.7,0.9,The MODEL ANSWER is mostly accurate but partially incomplete. It correctly identifies Livingston's distrust of pool explanations but adds an unsubstantiated claim about deception. The answer is somewhat clear but could be better organized.,0.2,0.5,5,9.251,2.064,233,61,border
27,Timing,Why did Livingston emphasize flexibility?,Because unexpected moves require quick adjustment.,"Livingston emphasized flexibility because he was trying to make a point about the unpredictability of stock market transactions. He mentioned that even with good brokers, you never know what the stock will cost until after the transaction is completed.",False,0.1666666666666666,0.5585194230079651,0.025,5.04,0.775,0.8,0.7,0.7,0.9,"The model answer is mostly accurate, but partially incomplete.

29,Timing,Why did Livingston warn against “hope” in trading?,Because hope causes delays that cost money.,"Livingston warned against ""hope"" in trading because when the market goes against a trader, they often hope that every day will be the last and their loss won't get worse. However, this hope can lead to impulsive decisions, making things worse instead of better.

In contrast, Livingston suggests that traders should fear losing more than they have already lost, rather than hoping for a quick turnaround. This approach requires discipline and patience, but it can help traders make more rational decisions and avoid further losses.",False,0.4285714285714285,0.6173740029335022,0.0416666666666666,12.348837209302326,0.825,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.9,"Answer is mostly accurate and complete, but some claims are not directly supported by the context.

33,Timing,Why did Livingston say traders must avoid pride?,Because pride prevents them from cutting losses.,"Livingston didn't say traders must avoid pride. However, he did discuss the importance of humility and avoiding overconfidence in trading.",False,0.1428571428571428,0.6532495617866516,0.037037037037037,2.875,0.825,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.9,"Answer is mostly accurate and complete, but Livingston's exact words are not quoted.

35,Timing,Why did Livingston say the public is often wrong?,Because they buy on hope and sell on fear.,"Livingston didn't say the public is often wrong.

36,Timing,Why did Livingston think tape reading is a profession?,Because it requires lifelong study and discipline.,"Livingston thought that tape reading was a profession because he believed it required specialized skills and knowledge. He also seemed to think that the ability to read the tape effectively was something that could be learned through experience, but not by just anyone.

In this context, Livingston's comment suggests that he viewed tape reading as a distinct profession or skill set, rather than simply a tool for making investment decisions.",False,0.2,0.6085702180862427,0.05,8.86,0.825,0.8,0.9,0.7,0.9,"The MODEL ANSWER is mostly accurate and complete, but it slightly misrepresents Livingston's view on tape reading.
