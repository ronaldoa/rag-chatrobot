38,Timing,Why did Livingston trust price action over advice?,Because he believed prices reflect true conditions sooner than talk.,"Livingston trusted price action over advice because he believed that the market's own movement was a more reliable indicator of its future direction than any individual's opinion or tip. This is evident in his conversation with Dolan, where he says ""I don't know how you discovered who I was; perhaps from the hotel register.""",False,0.3333333333333333,0.6652243137359619,0.0689655172413793,4.794117647058823,0.9,0.9,0.8,0.9,1.0,"Answer is mostly accurate and complete, and most claims are supported by the context.
