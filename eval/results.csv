However, based on the text, it seems that Livingston is suggesting that when a stock's price starts rising or falling, people start talking about why the price is moving in that direction.

One possible interpretation of an example that might illustrate this point is the case of Intervale Oil mentioned earlier in the text. In this example, the price of Intervale Oil rose to $50 due to manipulation by a pool of insiders. After the price peaked at $50 and then declined quickly, people started asking why Intervale Oil was so weak.

In response to these questions, some brokers who were members of the bull pool behind Intervale Oil's advance attributed the stock's weakness to a ""bear raid"" led by Larry Livingston. This example illustrates how news about a company or its stock can often follow changes in price action, rather than being driven by any underlying change in the company's fundamentals.
