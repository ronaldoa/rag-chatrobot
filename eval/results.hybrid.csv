Reasoning:
The model answer does not address the specific problem noticed by Livingston about the stock tables printed in newspapers. The model answer seems to be discussing a different topic altogether, which is the issue of delayed execution and uncertainty in trading prices. Therefore, the score for correctness should be 0.
