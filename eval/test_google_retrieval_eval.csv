There I was actually buying and selling stocks. The price of Sugar on the tape might be $105 and I could see a three-point drop coming. As a matter of fact, at the very moment the ticker was printing $105 on the tape the real price on the floor of the Exchange might be $104 or $103. By the time my order to sell a thousand shares got to Fullerton's floor man to execute, the price might be still lower. I couldn't tell at what price I had put out my thousand shares until I got a report from the clerk.
