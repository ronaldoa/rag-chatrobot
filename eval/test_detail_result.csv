1,Timing,"When the narrator (Livingston) left the bucket shops and began trading in a brokerage office, how did his tape-based timing method fail because the tape was “ancient history” and the printed prices lagged behind the real floor prices?","In a brokerage office, the tape was “ancient history”; the price printed on the tape was often behind actual trading on the floor, making his timing method fail.","The narrator's tape-based timing method failed because the printed prices on the tape lagged behind the real floor prices. This meant that by the time Livingston saw a price movement on the tape, it was already ""ancient history"" and no longer reflected the current market conditions.",False,0.625,0.8148285150527954,0.2765957446808511,1.7577639751552796,0.9,0.9,0.8,0.9,1.0,"Answer is accurate and complete, and all claims are supported by the context.

2,Timing,"In the episode where the narrator explains that in a brokerage office the tape was “ancient history,” why did he say he needed the tape to be absolutely current, and how did even a small delay in the quoted price make his timing method unreliable?","Because even a small delay in the quoted price made his signals unreliable, and he depended on precise timing for his trades.","The narrator said he needed the tape to be absolutely current because even a small delay in the quoted price could make his timing method unreliable.

In particular, if the narrator's order was fairly big, it would tend further to depress the price. This means that even a small delay in the quoted price could result in the narrator selling at a lower price than he intended, which would undermine his timing method.",False,0.6153846153846154,0.7214796543121338,0.23636363636363636,3.336,0.875,0.9,0.8,0.9,0.9,"Answer is mostly accurate and complete, and most claims are supported by the context.

In fact, the narrator emphasizes the importance of studying the tape before making a trade.

However, the narrator does mention that superficial students of the tape may conclude that the price is going to stop short of $150 and buy accordingly. But after the reaction begins, they hold on or sell out at a small loss.

The narrator also mentions that there can be differences between the printed tape price and the real floor price, which can cause traders to enter at the wrong moment.
