Timing,"When Livingston first worked as a quotation-board boy, how did he begin to anticipate price movements just by watching the tape and remembering past behavior?","As a quotation-board boy he developed a strong memory for prices and noticed that in both advances and declines stocks showed ""habits"" and parallel cases; by comparing the current tape action with how prices had behaved on previous days, he started to anticipate movements using only their past performance as his guide."
Timing,"What did Livingston mean when he said ""your business with the tape is now—not tomorrow,"" and why did he say that the reason for a move can wait?","He meant that a trader must act on what the tape is showing in the present instead of waiting for explanations or news; the tape records only what happens, not why, and the reasons for a move may come days or weeks later, but by then the trading opportunity is gone."
Timing,"Why did Livingston say he never asked the tape ""why,"" and what was his attitude toward explanations that come after the price move?","He said he never asked the tape ""why"" because the tape’s job is only to record price movements, not reasons; explanations usually appear long after the move is over, and he considered them irrelevant to the trader’s job, which is to act instantly on the tape rather than waiting for reasons."
Timing,"In the Hollow Tube example, how did Livingston use it to illustrate that the reason for a move often follows the price, not the other way around?","He recalled that while the rest of the market was rallying, Hollow Tube suddenly dropped three points; only the following Monday did the directors officially pass the dividend, revealing the reason. For Livingston this showed that insiders already knew and stopped buying, so the price move came first and the news explanation followed later."
Timing,"Why did Livingston say there was ""no inside buying"" in Hollow Tube before the bad news about the passed dividend, and how did this lack of buying affect the price?","He said there was no inside buying because those who knew what the directors intended either didn’t buy or even sold, so there was no informed demand to support the stock; with nobody ""inside"" willing to buy, the price sagged and broke several points before the official announcement."
Timing,How did Livingston use a memorandum book to train himself to recognize repeating price patterns and verify his tape-reading ideas?,"He kept a small notebook where he recorded how active stocks behaved before previous breaks or rallies and wrote down what he thought they would do in the next day or two; later he checked the real tape against his predictions, using this record of hits and misses to confirm whether his observations about repeating patterns were accurate."
Timing,"When Livingston moved from bucket shops to a real Stock Exchange broker, why did he say the tape ""talked ancient history"" for his old timing system?","In a real broker’s office there was a delay between the price printed on the tape and the actual floor price; by the time his sell order based on the tape reached the floor, the stock might already be several points lower, and if his order was large it could push the price further. His old system depended on instantaneous execution, so under these conditions the tape was giving him ""ancient history."""
Timing,How did the execution differences between bucket shops and Fullerton’s brokerage office cause Livingston’s previously successful bucket-shop system to fail?,"In bucket shops he could buy or sell the instant the price appeared on the tape, knew his exact execution price in advance, and his orders did not affect the market. In Fullerton’s office real orders went to the Exchange floor, might get worse prices than the printed quote, and his own size could move the market; these delays and slippage destroyed the precise timing edge his system relied on."
Timing,"According to Livingston, why is the desire for ""constant action"" dangerous for traders, especially compared with waiting for the right time to act?","He warned that many traders, even professionals, feel they must take money out of the market every day and keep trading for excitement; this craving for constant action leads them to trade without adequate reasons instead of waiting until precedents and conditions truly favor a play, and that impatience causes many losses."
Timing,"How did Livingston distinguish between ""beating the bucket shop"" and truly understanding stock speculation when he reflected on his early success?","He said that in bucket shops he had only learned to beat the shop by betting on short-term fluctuations; he did not yet understand the broader game of stock speculation on the Exchange, where his orders affected prices and execution delays mattered. Realizing this, he concluded that his early wins meant he could beat the shop’s setup, not that he already understood full-fledged market speculation."
Timing,"In what way did Livingston’s strong memory for numbers and early tape-reading practice continue to help him later, even after he moved beyond bucket shops?","His ability to remember detailed price sequences and recognize recurring patterns in the tape, trained as a quotation-board boy and refined in bucket shops, gave him a lasting edge in reading market behavior; he credited this tape-reading skill and memory, rather than formal ""brains"" or knowledge, as the foundation of his later success."
Timing,"What lesson did Livingston draw from the fact that ""there is nothing new in Wall Street,"" and how did this relate to his way of capitalizing experience?","He believed that whatever happens in the stock market has happened before and will happen again because speculation is as old as the hills; by remembering past price behavior and the conditions around it, he could recognize similar situations when they reappeared and ""capitalize experience"" by acting on precedents rather than treating each move as something entirely new."
Timing,"How did Livingston’s need for fast, accurate tape information conflict with the execution delays in a real broker’s office?","Because real trades took time to execute and often filled at worse prices than the tape quote, the printed tape was already outdated when his orders were filled, which destroyed the precise timing edge his method needed."
Timing,"Why did Livingston say that if your order is big, the tape quote becomes even less reliable?","Because a large order can push the price further away from the printed quote when it hits the market, so the tape price you saw is no longer close to the actual execution price."
Timing,Why did Livingston consider it dangerous to rely on stock tables printed in newspapers?,"Because the printed prices in newspaper tables often lagged several points behind the real market price, making them useless and dangerous as a basis for trading decisions."
Timing,"What did Livingston mean when he said that the tape records events, not reasons?","He meant that the tape only shows actual price movements and dealings, not the explanations behind them; those explanations come later and are not what a trader should act on."
Timing,Why did Livingston emphasize that price precedes news using the Hollow Tube case?,"Because Hollow Tube dropped points while the rest of the market rallied and only later did the directors pass the dividend, showing that price moved first based on what insiders knew and the public news followed afterward."
Timing,What did Livingston observe about traders who waited for explanations before acting?,He observed that traders who waited for reasons behind a move instead of acting on the tape usually missed the opportunity because explanations always come after the move has taken place.
Timing,How did Livingston train himself to detect repeating market patterns?,"He trained himself by writing down how stocks behaved before previous breaks or rallies in a memorandum book and then checking later whether similar behavior led to similar outcomes, gradually learning to recognize repeating patterns."
Timing,Why did Livingston’s bucket-shop strategy rely on instantaneous execution?,Because his method required acting the moment the price printed on the tape and getting fills at that price; any delay or slippage would ruin the fine timing his strategy depended on.
Timing,"Why did Livingston find that the tape in a brokerage office ""talked ancient history""?","Because the tape price was often behind the real floor price and by the time his order based on the tape reached the floor the market had already moved, so the tape was reporting what had already happened, not what he could still trade on."
Timing,"What made Livingston believe that ""there is nothing new in Wall Street""?","He saw that the same kinds of price moves and crowd behaviors kept repeating over time because human nature in speculation does not change, leading him to conclude that nothing in the market is truly new."
Timing,Why did Livingston say a trader should never fight the tape?,"Because the tape reflects the real action of the market, and opposing what the tape shows means fighting the actual flow of supply and demand, which is usually fatal to a trader."
Timing,Why did Livingston think that acting instantly on the tape is better than acting intelligently later?,"Because by the time a trader has a complete explanation, the move is usually over; the value of the tape lies in giving timely signals, not in supporting a slow, ""intelligent"" post-mortem."
Timing,Why must the tape be current?,"Because trading decisions and timing depend on immediate, accurate prices; delayed quotes destroy the usefulness of tape signals."
Timing,"Why doesn’t Livingston ask the tape ""why""?","Because the tape only records what happens and the reasons follow later, when the trading opportunity has already passed."
Timing,What does the tape record?,"It records only price movements and transactions, not the reasons or explanations behind them."
Timing,What was wrong with newspaper stock tables?,"Their quoted prices were often several points away from the real market prices by the time traders saw them, making them unreliable for trading."
Timing,Why do delayed prices cause losses?,"Because trades are mistimed when based on stale quotes, causing entries or exits at disadvantageous prices."
Timing,What showed Livingston that news follows price?,"The Hollow Tube case, where the stock fell before the official announcement that its dividend was passed."
Timing,Why was there no inside buying in Hollow Tube?,"Because insiders who knew the dividend was going to be passed either sold or refused to buy, leaving the stock without informed support."
Timing,"What made the tape ""ancient history"" in the broker’s office?","The delay between the tape quote and the actual floor price, so the tape was reporting prices that were already out of date when orders were executed."
Timing,How did Livingston learn patterns?,By keeping a memorandum book of price behavior and checking his predictions against actual tape movements until patterns became obvious to him.
Timing,What was his first trading method based on?,"On observing that prices had habits and repeated patterns, and using past performance as a guide to future moves."
Timing,Why does constant action hurt traders?,Because the desire to be in the market all the time leads them to trade without solid reasons instead of waiting for high-probability opportunities.
Timing,What advantage did bucket shops give?,"They allowed him to buy or sell instantly at the quoted tape price, with no delay and no impact on the market."
Timing,Why did his bucket-shop method fail in real markets?,"Because real Exchange trading involved delays, slippage, and market impact from his own orders, which destroyed the precise timing his bucket-shop method needed."
Timing,What does Livingston say about reasons appearing?,"He says that reasons for price moves generally appear long after the move, when it is too late to trade on them."
Timing,Why must a trader act instantly?,"Because the market will not wait, and hesitation means missing the move the tape is signaling."
Timing,Why were tape signals unreliable in Fullerton’s office?,Because the tape prices were behind the floor prices and his orders often executed at different levels than the printed quotes.
Timing,What made the tape misleading?,"The discrepancy between printed tape prices and the actual prices on the Exchange floor, which could cause wrong entries."
Timing,When did Livingston start working?,He started working as a quotation-board boy in a stock-brokerage office when he was just out of grammar school.
Timing,What did insiders do before Hollow Tube’s news?,"They either sold their holdings or refrained from buying, leaving the stock without support."
Timing,What confirms that patterns repeat?,"Livingston’s observation that similar price behaviors kept occurring under similar conditions across different markets and times, proving to him that market patterns repeat."
