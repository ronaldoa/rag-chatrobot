1,Strategy,Why was the author able to beat the game in bucket shops but failed initially in New York?,"At all events, what was a perfect system for trading in bucket shops didn't work in Fullerton's office. There I was actually buying and selling stocks. The price of Sugar on the tape might be $105 and I could see a three-point drop coming. As a matter of fact, at the very moment the ticker was printing $105 on the tape the real price on the floor of the Exchange might be $104 or $103. By the time my order to sell a thousand shares got to Fullerton's floor man to execute, the price might be still lower. I couldn't tell at what price I had put out my thousand shares until I got a report from the clerk. When I surely would have made three thousand on the same transaction in a bucket shop I might not make a cent in a Stock Exchange house.","The author was able to beat the game in bucket shops because he could manipulate the price fluctuations, which were not as sophisticated or regulated as those on a Stock Exchange house. In contrast, the author's trading style and strategies did not adapt well to the more complex and dynamic market conditions of New York.",False,0.15,0.749076247215271,0.17391304347826086,0.4327956989247312,0.825,0.8,0.7,0.9,0.9,"The MODEL ANSWER is mostly accurate and complete, but it slightly misrepresents the author's trading style and strategies.

2,Psychology,"What was the most important lesson Livingston learned from Mr. Partridge (""Old Turkey"")?","The vital importance of ""sitting tight"" in a bull market rather than trying to catch small fluctuations; big money is in the big swing.","The most important lesson Livingston learned from Mr. Partridge is not explicitly stated in this text snippet, but based on the context and the way Mr. Partridge interacts with his customers, it can be inferred that he teaches them about the importance of patience and waiting for the right moment to act.

However, if I had to choose a more specific lesson, it would be that Livingston learned from Mr. Partridge not to get caught up in individual fluctuations but rather to focus on the main market trends.",False,0.2857142857142857,0.5593472719192505,0.13333333333333333,3.762962962962963,0.7,0.7,0.8,0.5,0.8,"The model answer partially captures the lesson, but it's not explicitly stated in the text.

3,Strategy,"What is the ""stabilising process"" in stock manipulation?",Of course what I am really doing is covering stock I sold short at higher prices when the demand from the public or from the traders or from both enabled me to do it. These covering purchases of mine constitute what I call the stabilising process.,"The stabilizing process refers to a strategy used by market manipulators, such as Jesse Livermore, to artificially stabilize or support the price of a particular stock. This can be done through various means, including buying up large quantities of the stock, creating artificial demand, and using other tactics to influence the market price.

In this context, the stabilizing process is not about maintaining a fair and stable market price based on fundamental value, but rather about artificially supporting or manipulating the market price for the benefit of the manipulator.",False,0.125,0.719596266746521,0.0898876404494382,2.340080971659919,0.775,0.8,0.7,0.7,0.9,"The model answer is mostly accurate, but lacks some details.

4,Psychology,How must a successful speculator handle the natural human instincts of hope and fear?,"He must reverse them: he should fear that a small loss will grow into a big one, and hope that a profit will grow into a big profit.","A successful speculator must reverse their natural impulses, fearing when the market goes in their favor and hoping when it's against them. This allows them to make rational decisions based on the market's true direction, rather than being swayed by emotions.",False,0.3076923076923077,0.6587491035461426,0.1,1.9621212121212122,0.9,0.9,0.8,0.9,1.0,"Answer is mostly accurate and complete, and most claims are supported by the context.

5,Trading Rule,"What is Livingston's theory regarding a stock crossing the $100, $200, or $300 mark for the first time?","I think I have told you it has been my experience that whenever a stock crosses $100 or $200 or $300 for the first time, it nearly always keeps going up for 30 to 50 points and after $300 faster than after $100 or $200.","Livingston believes that when a stock crosses one of these significant price thresholds ($100, $200, or $300) for the first time, it will ""nearly always keep going up"" and reach an even higher price. He also thinks that after crossing $300, the stock is likely to move faster than after crossing lower thresholds like $100 or $200.",False,0.631578947368421,0.8496243953704834,0.36666666666666664,1.5114155251141552,0.9,0.9,0.8,0.9,1.0,"Answer is mostly accurate and complete, and most claims are supported by the context.

6,Market History,"Why did the ""coffee deal,"" which Livingston considered a conservative investment, result in a loss?","They fixed on a maximum price for raw coffee and also fixed a time limit for closing out all existing contracts. This decision meant, of course, that the Coffee Exchange would have to go out of business. There was only one thing for me to do and I did it, and that was to sell out all my contracts. Those profits of millions that I had deemed as certain to come my way as any I ever made failed completely to materialise.","The coffee deal resulted in a loss because the market continued inactive and the price of coffee did not go up as expected by Livingston. He carried his line for nine long months without any significant gain, ultimately selling out all his options when they expired.",False,0.11428571428571428,0.7575931549072266,0.16279069767441862,0.6318289786223278,0.825,0.8,0.7,0.9,0.9,"The MODEL ANSWER is mostly accurate, but lacks some details from the REFERENCE ANSWER.

7,Manipulation,"According to the text, when is the principal marketing (selling) of a manipulated stock done?","The principal marketing of the stock, as you know, is done on the way down.

8,Strategy,"Why does Livingston say one should never ""argue with the tape""?",To be angry at the market because it unexpectedly or even illogically goes against you is like getting mad at your lungs because you have pneumonia.,"Livingston says one should never ""argue with the tape"" because it is futile to try to understand or explain why market fluctuations are happening. The tape simply records what is happening, without providing explanations for the underlying causes of price movements. By not trying to argue with the tape, one can focus on reading and interpreting its message in order to make informed trading decisions.",False,0.14285714285714285,0.5618305206298828,0.10294117647058823,2.722972972972973,0.9,0.9,0.8,0.9,1.0,"Answer is mostly accurate and complete, and most claims are supported by the context.

9,Market Analysis,How did Livingston determine there was no buying power in the wheat market before the big break?,the way in which the market took my wheat and the disproportionate decline on my selling told me that there was no buying power there.,"Livingston determined there was no buying power in the wheat market by observing that when he sold his wheat, the price went down 1-¼ cents on his selling. This disproportionate decline told him that there was no buying power in the market.",False,0.8333333333333334,0.7731298804283142,0.40540540540540543,1.791044776119403,0.875,0.9,0.8,0.9,0.9,"Answer is mostly accurate and complete, and most claims are supported by the context.
