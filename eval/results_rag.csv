Reason: The model answer correctly identifies the failure of Livingston's tape-based timing method in a brokerage office, where the printed prices on the tape lag behind the real floor prices.

The score is 0 because the model answer failed to address the question directly. It did not acknowledge any discrepancies between the printed tape price and the real floor price, which could cause a trader to enter at the wrong moment.

Explanation:
The model answer is incomplete and does not provide a clear explanation for why the narrator said he never asked the tape “why.” 

To score correctness from 0 to 1, we need more information or context about the situation. However, based on the provided reference answer, it seems that the correct reason for the narrator's statement is indeed related to the limitations of the tape in recording reasons.
