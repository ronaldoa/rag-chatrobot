0,1,Timing,"When the narrator (Livingston) left the bucket shops and began trading in a brokerage office, how did his tape-based timing method fail because the tape was “ancient history” and the printed prices lagged behind the real floor prices?","In a brokerage office, the tape was “ancient history”; the price printed on the tape was often behind actual trading on the floor, making his timing method fail.","The narrator's tape-based timing method failed when he tried to trade on the ticker tape. The problem was that by the time the order got executed, the price had already dropped further due to the delay between the printed prices on the tape and the actual floor prices.

1,2,Timing,"In the episode where the narrator explains that in a brokerage office the tape was “ancient history,” why did he say he needed the tape to be absolutely current, and how did even a small delay in the quoted price make his timing method unreliable?","Because even a small delay in the quoted price made his signals unreliable, and he depended on precise timing for his trades.","Based on the provided information, I cannot fully answer this question. The context mentions that when the narrator's order was executed by the brokers' floor man, it would already be 20 points lower than what the tape showed at the time of execution.
