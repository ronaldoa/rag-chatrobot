1,Timing,"When the narrator (Livingston) left the bucket shops and began trading in a brokerage office, how did his tape-based timing method fail because the tape was “ancient history” and the printed prices lagged behind the real floor prices?","In a brokerage office, the tape was “ancient history”; the price printed on the tape was often behind actual trading on the floor, making his timing method fail.","The narrator's tape-based timing method failed because the printed prices on the tape lagged behind the real floor prices. This meant that by the time Livingston saw a price movement on the tape, it was already ""ancient history"" and no longer reflected the current market conditions.",False,0.625,0.8148285150527954,0.2765957446808511,1.7577639751552796,0.8,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.058,0.125,5,8.015,0.837,283,161
2,Timing,"In the episode where the narrator explains that in a brokerage office the tape was “ancient history,” why did he say he needed the tape to be absolutely current, and how did even a small delay in the quoted price make his timing method unreliable?","Because even a small delay in the quoted price made his signals unreliable, and he depended on precise timing for his trades.","The narrator said he needed the tape to be absolutely current because even a small delay in the quoted price could make his timing method unreliable.

In particular, the narrator's system of trading relied on identifying trends and patterns in stock prices. However, if the tape was not up-to-date, it would mean that the narrator's information about market conditions was also outdated.

As a result, even a small delay in the quoted price could lead to incorrect decisions being made based on out-of-date information. This highlights the importance of having access to real-time data when making trading decisions.",False,0.6923076923076923,0.6882204413414001,0.2077922077922078,4.928,0.8,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.1,0.182,5,10.274,0.948,616,125
3,Timing,"Why did the narrator say that tape reading in a brokerage office was dangerously misleading, especially because the printed tape price could differ from the real floor price, causing a trader to enter at the wrong moment?",Because discrepancies between the printed tape price and the real floor price could cause a trader to enter at the wrong moment.,"The narrator did not say that tape reading in a brokerage office was dangerously misleading. In fact, the narrator emphasizes the importance of studying the tape before making a trade.

However, the narrator does mention that superficial students of the tape may conclude that the price is going to stop short of $150 and buy accordingly. But after the reaction begins, they hold on or sell out at a small loss.

The narrator also mentions that there can be differences between the printed tape price and the real floor price, which can cause traders to enter at the wrong moment. However, this is not presented as a criticism of tape reading itself, but rather as one of the potential pitfalls that traders need to be aware of when using the tape in their trading decisions.",False,0.7857142857142857,0.7852499485015869,0.16853932584269662,6.0546875,0.6,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.136,0.227,5,12.455,1.296,775,128
4,Timing,"According to the narrator, what was the problem with the stock tables printed in newspapers, and how were the printed prices often several points away from the real market price, making them useless for trading decisions?","He observed that newspaper prices were often several points away from the real market price, making them useless for trading decisions.","The narrator states that the printed prices in newspapers often lagged behind the actual market price, resulting in a divergence of several points. This made the printed prices useless for trading decisions, as they did not reflect the current market reality.",False,0.6666666666666666,0.8207478523254395,0.2857142857142857,1.9185185185185185,0.8,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.133,0.208,5,5.688,0.914,259,135
5,Timing,"Why did the narrator insist that a trader’s business with the tape is “now,” emphasizing that the market does not wait for explanations or news, and that a trader must act instantly instead of waiting for reasons?",Because a trader must act instantly; the market does not wait for explanations or news to arrive.,"The narrator emphasizes that a trader's business with the tape is ""now"" because the market does not wait for explanations or news. The narrator suggests that if a trader waits for reasons, they will be left behind and miss opportunities to act in the market.",False,0.7,0.7403278946876526,0.358974358974359,2.6597938144329896,0.8,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.2,0.444,5,4.797,0.856,258,97
6,Timing,"According to the narrator, what happens when a trader delays action and waits for reasons behind a price move, instead of acting on what the tape shows, and why does he say that the reasons usually appear long after the price has already moved?","He misses the opportunity because reasons appear much later, long after the price has moved.","According to the narrator, when a trader delays action and waits for reasons behind a price move, instead of acting on what the tape shows, he usually ends up losing money. The narrator says that this is because ""millions upon millions of dollars have been lost by men who bought stocks because they looked cheap or sold them because they looked dear.""

The narrator also explains why waiting for reasons behind a price move can be detrimental to traders: it's because the reasons usually appear long after the price has already moved. The narrator says that this is what happened in his own case, where he was delayed by waiting for reasons and ended up losing money due to the divergence between the printed and actual prices.",False,0.6363636363636364,0.7412916421890259,0.11494252873563218,7.913043478260869,0.8,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.128,0.16,5,12.176,1.091,728,92
7,Timing,"Why did the narrator say he never asked the tape “why,” stressing that the tape only records what happens (price movements) and that the reasons usually come out only after the move is over?","Because the tape only records movements, not reasons, and reasons usually come after the move is over.","The narrator stresses that he never asked the tape ""why"" because it only records what happens (price movements) and not the reasons behind them. The narrator implies that trying to understand why a stock is moving can be futile, as the underlying reasons may not become clear until after the move has occurred.",False,0.8181818181818182,0.7452569007873535,0.2608695652173913,3.0392156862745097,0.8,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.111,0.167,5,6.011,0.754,310,102
8,Timing,"What example involving the stock Hollow Tube does the narrator give to show that news often follows price action, where the stock dropped several points before the official news that its dividend was passed?","He cites the case of Hollow Tube, which dropped several points before the official news that its dividend was passed.","The narrator gives the example of Hollow Tube, where it dropped three points on a particular day while the rest of the market rallied sharply. The next Monday, the directors passed the dividend, which was the reason for the earlier price action.",False,0.5,0.7462021112442017,0.23809523809523808,2.094017094017094,0.8,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.108,0.208,5,5.348,1.182,245,117
9,Timing,"In the Hollow Tube example, why did the narrator say there was no inside buying before the bad news that the dividend was to be passed, and how did people who knew the truth either sell beforehand or avoid buying, leaving no support for the price?","Because people who knew the dividend was going to be passed either sold beforehand or avoided buying, leaving no support for the price.","The narrator said there was no inside buying before the bad news because insiders, who knew exactly why they should not buy their own stock in a bull market, were selling instead. 

This meant that people who knew the truth either sold beforehand or avoided buying, leaving no support for the price.",False,0.7857142857142857,0.7200990319252014,0.34,2.214814814814815,0.8,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.145,0.227,5,5.631,1.471,299,135
